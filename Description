Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning
Overview
This project implements an AI-powered brain tumor classification model using deep learning. The model analyzes MRI/CT scan images to detect and classify brain tumors with high accuracy. It is designed to assist medical professionals by providing a second opinion and speeding up the diagnosis process.

Features
Deep Learning Model: Trained using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for accurate classification.
High Confidence Predictions: Provides tumor classification with confidence scores.
Automated Report Generation: Generates detailed reports, including tumor type, symptoms, and precautionary steps.
User-Friendly Interface: Can be integrated into a web or mobile application for easy accessibility.
Advantages
Faster Diagnosis: Reduces the time required for manual analysis of MRI/CT scans.
Higher Accuracy: Trained on a large dataset, ensuring reliable classification.
Clinical Support: Acts as an assistive tool for radiologists and medical professionals.
Scalability: Can be extended to detect multiple types of brain tumors.
Future Improvements
Enhanced Model Performance: Further fine-tuning and dataset expansion for improved accuracy.
Integration with Cloud Services: Deploying on cloud platforms for remote accessibility.
Real-Time Prediction API: Developing an API for seamless integration with hospital systems.
Multi-Tumor Detection: Extending the model to classify additional types of brain tumors.
Explainability Features: Providing heatmaps or region-based highlighting to show affected areas.
